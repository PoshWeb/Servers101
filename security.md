This module is designed to help anyone understand how to build their own server.

Each of the educational servers in this module should run as a low-rights user on a randomized loopback port.

Each of the educational servers are short and easy to inspect for malicious code.

If you find that an educational server is being used in a malicious way or find a security issue with any of the educational servers, please file an issue.
