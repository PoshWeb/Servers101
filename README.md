# Servers 101

Servers are pretty simple.

You listen and then you reply.

That's Servers 101.

## Simple Servers

Frameworks often abstract this away.

This can make the basics of servers harder to learn.

To avoid reliance on the framework flavor of the week, it's good to learn how to build a simple server.

This is a collection of simple servers in PowerShell.
